This is a productivity app that will allow the user to make a "homepage" that will allow them to stay productive!

Front and center there is a clock that will help you to keep track of time. 

When you click on the "home" button this will clear the top area so that there wont be distractions there. 

There is a weather api that allows you to check the weather without having to pull out another device or go to a different site. 
The current API that is loaded is "Visual Crossing Weather". You will need to add your own key. You could also replace this with another weather API if you wish. 

A calculator is built in which means you wont have to leave this app for any simple math you need to do. 

You can easily take notes and there is a function built in to copy them or clear as needed. This means that you can jot down any quick notes and when you are done you can transfer them to a different app as needed for more long term storage. 

It has a built in timer so that you can stay productive and make sure you are on time. 
It will give you an alert when the time is up so that you can take a break/get back to work!

The "tunes" tab allows you to use a web embed to add in a playlist and listen to any music while you work. When you click on another tab the video will dissapear from view so that you can stay focused. 
No more scrolling through pages of youtube while you should be working on something!
You will need to add the link to your embed to a video or playlist. 
This can be done in the settings tab  

There is a to-do list so you can set your goals for each section and check them off as you accomplish them!

The settings tab allows you to input a youtube embed and lets you add more links to the bottom of the screen. 

At the bottom there is a space for links that will allow you to add the sites that you need, but stay away from the sites you dont!
